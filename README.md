# Behavior-Graph

This respository is created as a fork from Ben Houston's [behave-graph](https://github.com/bhouston/behave-graph), and incorporates code from [behave-flow](https://github.com/beeglebug/behave-flow) for the user interface.  It takes the existing functionality, and moves the behavior graph to an evm compatible blockchain.

This was made for the [EthGlobal EthSf hackathon](https://sf.ethglobal.com/)
