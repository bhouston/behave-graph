# Behavior-Graph

This respository is created as a fork from Ben Houston's [behave-graph](https://github.com/bhouston/behave-graph), and incorporates code from [behave-flow](https://github.com/beeglebug/behave-flow) for the user interface.  It takes the existing functionality, and enables a scene to be edited side by side with the node-based editor, and allows the scene graphs to be stores on IPFS and evm compatible blockchains.

This was made for the [EthGlobal EthSf hackathon](https://sf.ethglobal.com/)
